					<p>In 2010, inspired by an article on World War I's Four Minute Men, I proposed a short series of educational presentations for my company. Personal/professional development is difficult in a small company and these presentations offered a way to enlighten people about a useful concept without boring them.</p> 
					<p>The presentations were a success. Employees liked them, managers liked them, and company executives once talked about recording them for the rest of the company. I did the first seven, using the seventh to train others on how to give a presentation, and created an online library where the presentations could be viewed.</p>
