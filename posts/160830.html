        <h3><a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/at-home/blogs/in-priase-scruffy-hospitality">In praise of scruffy hospitality - Robin Shreeves</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">Robin Shreeves <a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/at-home/blogs/in-priase-scruffy-hospitality">writes a terrific article about how not to let perfectionism in house cleaning limit welcoming others</a>:</p>	
        <blockquote>Before kids, entertaining for me meant a whirlwind deep cleaning of the entire house. Not being a zealous housekeeper, I used to joke that I had to entertain or my home would never get a thorough cleaning. When I first had kids, I ended up entertaining a lot less, partly because of the mess in the house that I no longer had time to deal with.<br><br>Then one day, a woman I very much admired said something so simple. She said whenever someone was coming to her home — a home with five children in it — and she started to worry about how her home looked, she would stop and think: "Are they coming to see me, or are they coming to see my home?" It occurred to her that someone who would have a problem with her home looking like a family of seven lived in it wasn't really someone's opinion she cared about.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">Shreeves illustrates an important distinction between hospitality and entertaining. It's a distinction worth considering, so <a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/at-home/blogs/in-priase-scruffy-hospitality">go read the article</a>.</p>
