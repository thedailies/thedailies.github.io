        <h3><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/surprising-discoveries-pages-old-books">Things found between the pages of old books</a></h3>
        <p class="comment"><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/surprising-discoveries-pages-old-books">Atlas Obscura posted this delightful article</a>, which blew up appropriately on the internet, asking readers to document the best, strangest, most interesting things they've seen between the pages of old books. The stories range from heartwarming (love letters) to macabre (body parts) and just weird (apple tarts). Here's a couple favorites:</p>
        <blockquote>In September 2005, I visited Powell’s Books in Portland, Oregon, and bought a used trade paperback copy of William Gibson’s Pattern Recognition. Inside I found a credit card receipt for the book, which had been purchased on July 10, 2004, at LAX airport. I also found a boarding pass for an American Airlines flight on July 21, 2004, from New York’s JFK airport to LAX, issued to the same person whose name was on the book receipt. But none of that was the really interesting part.<br><br>Also in the book were a Russian 50 ruble note (worth about 87 cents today) and small scrap of paper bearing the words “I LIKE HAM!” printed in black Sharpie. The other side of the paper bore a faint repeating pattern of a yellow Chihuahua dog. Was it the dog who liked ham? Did the owner of the book buy ham in Russia and get 50 rubles in change? And, most important, did he like the book? —Michael Rene Zuzel, Talent, Oregon<br><br>...<br><br>An old family Bible contained an envelope with a note on the outside saying, “Grandfather’s revolutionary war pay.” Inside was a colonial currency bill and a signed receipt for its payment for service in the Connecticut 2nd Continental line. —W. Kevin Dougherty, Brackney, Pennsylvania</blockquote>
