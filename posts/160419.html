         <p class="def">A plot or scheme, usually designed to outwit an opponent. It has nothing to do with gems unless it's specifically about them. Does that make sense? It shouldn't because deception is our stratagem! And so is telling you this!</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/14/11411564/how-tv-gets-made-americans-fx-production">How a TV show gets made</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">There's a lot of well-produced TV right now. One of the best shows is FX's <em>The Americans</em>, a Cold War spy drama. Caroline Framke spent a few months <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/14/11411564/how-tv-gets-made-americans-fx-production">observing how an episode of <em>The Americans</em> gets made</a>. It's quite an affair:</p>
        <blockquote>The ability to make decisions quickly and confidently is imperative for showrunners. While I was talking to the J's, they realized with an amused sort of horror that between final script touches, production, and editing, they were simultaneously working on just about all 13 episodes of season four — not to mention looking ahead to season five.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">Behind all the organized chaos, there's a surprisingly unsurprising way to make good things with a lot of people: get them all on the same page.</p>
		<blockquote>Everyone on The Americans is working toward the same goal. This sounds like an obvious statement, but trust me: With so many variables in play and so little time to get everything done, that kind of teamwork is both rare and prized. If a set is like a train hurtling toward its destination, any bit of discord on the route clashes against the tracks and creates a warning spark — and the more that happens, the more likely it is that the whole thing will derail.<br><br>But with showrunners Weisberg and Fields steady at the helm, and drama-free lead actors Russell and Rhys in front of the camera, The Americans is clear-eyed in its vision. Even if not everyone knows exactly where it’s going, everyone’s role is defined, valued, and, most importantly, trusted. With that trust comes a rich world full of possibilities.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">Framke's article is a great long read. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/14/11411564/how-tv-gets-made-americans-fx-production">Check it out now</a>.</p>
