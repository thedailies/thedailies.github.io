         <h3><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/binge-reading-disorder">You read 100,000 words a day and remember 0</a></h3>
         <p class="comment">Over at The Morning News, <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/binge-reading-disorder">Nikkitha Bakshani explores what she calls Binge Reading Disorder</a>, or our propensity to read lots of content—lots of GOOD content—and process or remember little if any of it.</p>
         <p class="comment">Why is this a problem? For one, Bakshani notes that people are more likely to tweet a link to an article if they have not read it fully. And part of this is because as we've designed more and more things in the F-shaped pattern for reading online things, we've trained our brains to not look for things in other places. If you did that with a novel, you'd miss crucial plot details. But our online reading doesn't require such attention, let alone comprehension. Like, basic comprehension:</p>
         <blockquote>In Salomon’s study, student volunteers are asked to read texts that are heavy with common knowledge statements, such as “the Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean” and “Thomas Edison invented the light bulb,” but the texts were also populated with purposefully incorrect statements, such as “the Atlantic Ocean is the largest ocean” and “Ben Franklin invented the light bulb.” Similar to the Wästlund study, volunteers were then asked to take memory tests, in which they were quizzed about the facts mentioned in the text. About 20 to 30 percent of the time, volunteers answered the common knowledge questions about the largest ocean and the inventor of the light bulb incorrectly. Keep in mind these participants are students from one of the country’s top 20 universities.</blockquote>
         <p class="comment">It's an article well worth your time, attention, and musing.</p>
