		     <p class="def">Ok, so like, there was this word and—no, wait—I was on a call yesterday and it was going on. I'm just sitting there. There's not a lot for me to do and I can't get a word in. So they're talking and not letting us talk and we started wondering if they realized what they were doing. Probably not, right. But they still did what they were doing. So we kept following their lead because it's their meeting. The meeting ended eventually. Oh—but they asked us a question in it, and when they explained it, all of us were confused. It went in a complete circle, except it ended in another place. We didn't know how to answer. It was a long meeting with a lot of sidetracks. But we finished it!</p>

       <p class="comment">Moose Jaw is a small city in Saskatchewan, Canada, that is home to the world's tallest moose statue. Mac the Moose has proudly stood 32 feet tall, a popular destination for (some) tourists. BUT—a town in Norway just put up a gleaming, steel moose statue that is one measly foot taller. The Canadians nearly lost their maple syrup:</p>

       <p class="comment">The best reporting on this comes from the Canadian CTV website, where you can <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/norway-town-ready-to-battle-canadian-city-for-world-s-tallest-moose-statue-1.4258436">read or watch the history of the controversy</a>. Sometimes, you just have to smile and shake your head, and this is one of those times.</p>
       <p class="comment">But there's more! Earlier this week, the Moose Jaw mayor announced plans to upgrade Mac the Moose by <a href="https://regina.ctvnews.ca/a-national-treasure-larger-rack-aims-to-make-mac-the-tallest-moose-again-1.4262192">replacing the current antlers with a bigger set of antlers</a>. Not to be outdone, the Norwegian town's mayor said that they already had permission to make their moose potentially “twice as high”—and also to repaint it in gold.</p>
       <p class="comment">Buckle up, moose friends. This is gonna be fantastic.</p>
