        <h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-things-cost-what-danny-lenihan">Why things cost what they do</a></h3>
		<p class="comment">Danny Lenihan runs the company 3 Legged Thing, which makes high-quality tripods and tripod accessories. Recently, 3 Legged Thing released a new product, a universal L bracket, which retails for $49.99. Although feedback was positive, some people noted that they could "get something from China for $6 that works fine." Frustrated, Lenihan wrote <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-things-cost-what-danny-lenihan">an excellent explanation for why things cost what they do</a>.</p>
		<blockquote>3: Factory Standards<br>
    	Working conditions is an important part of our company ethos, as it is for most manufacturers in our industry. Sure, I could make things cheaper - the first factory I worked with, with one of my other brands back in 2005, was a total chop shop - I pulled out of there when I realised how bad the conditions were. That was a steep learning curve for me - since then, I inspect any factory for compliance to health and safety regulations before deciding whether or not to trial them, and I always, always stay at the factory for first production, to see that workers are treated fairly, provided with the necessary tools and safety equipment required to do their jobs properly.<br><br>
    	I’ve seen factories where the conditions are appalling. Where old ladies sit with woollen gloves, using their hands to knock burrs off die cast components, blood pouring up their arms. Where moulds that weigh over 600kg are carted around on rusty chains by workers with no safety helmets, wearing sandals or flip flops. Where workers using lathes or DMC’s sit with sparks flying at them, no goggles on, hands covered in splinters.<br><br>
    	It’s inhumane. And for us, unacceptable. But sure, you can have an L Bracket for six dollars.</blockquote>
     	<p class="comment">Look: doing good things takes a lot of work. Doing really good things over and over takes an incredible amount of work. A workman is worthy of his or her wages, and paying for quality isn't just a way to help them out. It's also a statement that doing things properly, safely, with regard for the consumer, honestly is valued.</p> 
     	<p class="comment">Lenihan is right: when we buy cheap, we're hurting everyone. Sometimes, we need to see how the sausage gets made to realize what goes into it. Lenihan has done that here. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-things-cost-what-danny-lenihan">Go read the whole article.</a>.</p>
