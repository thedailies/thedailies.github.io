       <p class="comment">It's a two-for-one today. First, there's excellent advice from Lifehacker <a href="https://vitals.lifehacker.com/buy-the-cheap-thing-first-1832358114">about how to balance buying for quality with not wasting money</a>:</p>
       <blockquote>When you’re new to a sport, you don’t yet know what specialized features you will really care about. You probably don’t know whether you’ll stick with your new endeavor long enough to make an expensive purchase worth it. And when you’re a beginner, it’s not like beginner level equipment is going to hold you back.<br><br>
       Take rock climbing shoes, for instance: as a beginner, you’ll scrape the [expletive] out of them because you haven’t learned how to properly place your feet. Better to wear through a cheap pair of climbing shoes while you’re learning, instead of ruining a fancy pair you don’t know how to use properly.<br><br>...<br><br>
       Wearing out your beginner gear is like graduating. You know that you’ve stuck with the sport long enough that you aren’t truly a beginner anymore. You may have managed to save up some cash for the next step. And you can buy the nicer gear now, knowing exactly what you want and need.</blockquote>
       <p class="comment">The correlating piece is one from Serious Eats, which talks you through <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/cooking-equipment-to-buy-at-restaurant-supply-store.html">upgrading your kitchen tools through a restaurant supply store</a>:</p>
       <blockquote>Investing in quality cookware can be a very, very expensive undertaking. You want the metal of most of your stainless steel skillets and saucepans to be thick enough to minimize hot spots and efficiently conduct and retain heat. One option is buying cookware with cladding that goes up the sides, which helps prevent scorching on the walls and corners of the pan. But fully-clad pans are expensive to produce, leading to price tags that are easily one or two hundred dollars apiece. A cheaper option: pans with a thick metal disc on the bottom and thin side walls, a construction that restaurant supply stores tend to stock. For most tasks, they perform perfectly well, and the cost savings can be significant. If you're just starting to build your cookware collection, this type of pan is one of your better bets.</blockquote>
