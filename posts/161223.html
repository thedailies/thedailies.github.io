        <h3><a href="http://lundybancroft.com/">The Holidays and domestic abuse</a></h3>
		  <p class="comment">Hey y’all. This is gonna be a different kind of post. Normally on The Dailies, we make a conscious effort to focus on the beautiful, fun, and enjoyable things in the world. We do this because we know the world is a broken but beautiful place, and focusing on the sublime things around us is a necessary fight in day-to-day life.</p>
		  <p class="comment">Today is different. Over the last year, we’ve encountered so many stories of abuse. It’s been as exhausting as it is heartbreaking. And so, today, as we approach the core of the holiday season, when domestic violence and abuse often spike, we want to highlight that this is a thing and there are actions that we can take to help those caught in it.</p>
		  <p class="comment">(Side note: we know that The Dailies is often read in schools. We’ll be sensitive but we understand if this is too weighty for some classrooms. In that case, there’s a Happy Friday link. However, we would ask you to consider discussing this with the kids in the class in case it's affecting some of them.)</p>
		  <p class="comment">There are plenty of resources available for those caught in abuse but the first challenge, as with everything, is being able to understand what is happening. Everyone—whether bystander, victim, or friend—needs to know what abuse looks like. This is where stories are important, and that’s where we want to focus today.</p>
		  <p class="comment">First, <a href="http://www.strongerthanespresso.com/holiday-healing">Stronger Than Espresso’s “Holiday Healing” tree</a> provides a platform for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault to describe their situation while also filling out a Christmas tree.</p>
		  <p class="comment">Also, for those inside a church, where the abuse can take a different look, <a href="https://spiritualsoundingboard.com/">Spiritual Sounding Board has a good archive</a> of stories, some commentary, and helpful links.</p>
		  <p class="comment">Finally, <a href="http://lundybancroft.com/">Lundy Bancroft’s site and resources</a> come highly recommended to us by some who have walked through these dark situations.</p>
		  <p class="comment">This is somber and perhaps not “seasonally-appropriate.” But this season has involved somberness from its very beginning. The manger ends at the cross. The season ultimately is about remaking the world and righting its wrongs. Helping someone caught in abuse to escape and rebuild their lives is one way to be part of that process.</p>
		  <p class="comment">So be alert to signs of abuse. Be engaged with your family and friends. Love the ones who are close to you. Consider the weak, the wronged, and the hurting. Above all, keep in mind the bigger picture and be part of it where you can.</p>
		  <p class="comment">Merry Christmas!</p>
