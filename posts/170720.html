        <h3><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2017/03/how_a_merriam_webster_editor_captured_take_for_the_dictionary.html">How a lexicographer creates an entry for a dictionary</a></h3>
		<p class="comment">Lexicographers are the guardians of the dictionary. They sort through all the possible uses for a word and write the definition of what that word means. This is always interesting—word usage changes over time and there can be many, many definitions for words. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2017/03/how_a_merriam_webster_editor_captured_take_for_the_dictionary.html">Slate has a great book excerpt that shows how interesting and challenging this can be</a>:</p>
		<blockquote>My first citation read, “She was taken aback.” I exhaled in relief: This is simple. I scanned the galley and found the appropriate definition—“to catch or come upon in a particular situation or action” (sense 3b)—and began my pile. The next handful of citations were similarly dispatched—a pile for sense 2, a pile for sense 1a, a pile for sense 7d—and I began to relax. In spite of its size, this is no different from any other batch, I reasoned. I am going to whip through this, and then I am going to take a two-week vacation, visit my local library, and go outside.<br><br>
		Fate, now duly tempted, intervened. My next cit read, “Reason has taken a back seat to sentiment.” I confidently flipped it onto the pile with “taken aback” and then reconsidered. This use of “take” didn’t really mean “to catch or come upon in a particular situation or action,” did it? I tried substitution: Reason did not catch or come upon a backseat. No: Reason was made secondary to sentiment. I scanned the galleys and saw nothing that matched, then put the citation in a “new sense” pile. But before I could grab the next citation, I thought, “Unless ... ”<br><br>
		When a lexicographer says “unless ... ” in the middle of defining, you should turn out the lights and go home, first making sure you’ve left them a supply of water and enough nonperishable food to last several days. “Unless ... ” almost always marks the beginning of a wild lexical goose chase.</blockquote>
