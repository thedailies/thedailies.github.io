        <h3><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/why-are-americas-farmers-killing-themselves-in-record-numbers">America's farmers and suicide</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">Today, we have a heavy article to post, but a very, very good one. Debbie Weingarten, a former farmer, looks at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/why-are-americas-farmers-killing-themselves-in-record-numbers">the incredibly high and rising numbers of farmers in America who are committing suicide</a>. Just how many may surprise you:</p>
        <blockquote>“Farming has always been a stressful occupation because many of the factors that affect agricultural production are largely beyond the control of the producers,” wrote Rosmann in the journal Behavioral Healthcare. “The emotional wellbeing of family farmers and ranchers is intimately intertwined with these changes.”<br><br>Last year, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that people working in agriculture – including farmers, farm laborers, ranchers, fishers, and lumber harvesters – take their lives at a rate higher than any other occupation. The data suggested that the suicide rate for agricultural workers in 17 states was nearly five times higher compared with that in the general population.<br><br>After the study was released, Newsweek reported that the suicide death rate for farmers was more than double that of military veterans. This, however, could be an underestimate, as the data collected skipped several major agricultural states, including Iowa. Rosmann and other experts add that the farmer suicide rate might be higher, because an unknown number of farmers disguise their suicides as farm accidents.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">Weingarten's article stands out because of its tone and approach. As a former farmer, Weingarten has the empathy needed to write such an article but also the understanding of how this became such a problem and how the challenges of farming affect the community. Unlike a lot of good thinkpieces today, this one does not hammer home the hopeless challenges of this situation. Weingarten knows the situation is dire. Her focus is on the humans, and she keeps the focus there. By the end, we care about the farmers and the hardness of their plight rather than being angry at the hopelessness of societal structure.</p>
