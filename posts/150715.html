         <h3><a href="http://bestof.metafilter.com/2015/06/Alma-Mater-Blotter">Alma Mater Blotter</a></h3>
         <p class="comment">Two-part story here. On MetaFilter, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/150445/Teens-In-Ties">someone posted the 1911 Spokane High School Yearbook</a>, which was hilarious. Each graduate had a description, occupation, ambition, and song. Most are interesting or amusing, some are terrifying, and others feel oddly modern:</p>
         <blockquote>Albert Edward Abbot<br />
         Description: Decidedly weak.<br />
         Occupation: Smoking stogies.</blockquote>
         <blockquote>Hugh Brown<br />
         Description: Crazy.<br />
         Occupation: Breathing.<br />
         Ambition: To be a bartender.</blockquote>
         <blockquote>Phyllis B Johnson<br />
         Ambition: To murder the faculty.</blockquote>
         <p class="comment">The second part of the story is that intrepid MeFites <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/150445/Teens-In-Ties#6086092">started sleuthing and discovered what happened to a lot of the people in the yearbook</a>. The results were fascinating: some people fulfilled their ambitions, some were involved in historically significant events, and others did something totally different:</p>
         <blockquote>George Albert Pynn became a dentist in Spokane, but not before becoming a basketball star and swim coach at the University of Minnesota.<br /><br />
This was a turn of events of sorts for Pynn, who in 1907, several years before this yearbook was published, was expelled for participating in an egg-throwing assault on the principal.<br /><br />
This principal turned out to be a magnet for controversy, and he was removed from office in 1907 or 1908. You can read more about all the stories that swirled around Principal Cloyd by searching the Google Newspaper archives: principal cloyd site:news.google.com/newspapers. (And maybe Chronicling America -- I didn't search for him there.)</blockquote>
