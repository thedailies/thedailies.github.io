        <h3><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/tv/a19435419/how-to-write-a-jeopardy-clue/">How to write a <em>Jeopardy!</em> clue"</a></h3>
        <p class="comment"><em>Jeopardy!</em> has been on the air since the 1960s, cranking out 61 trivia questions each weekday. That's a lot of material for any show, but especially for a show that takes its code creation so seriously. A <em>Jeopardy!</em> question has a bit of an art to it, as <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/tv/a19435419/how-to-write-a-jeopardy-clue/">this <em>Popular Mechanics</em> article details</a>:</p>
        <blockquote>“There’s a saying in quiz shows,” Wisse says, “that a good question has to get one of three reactions: ‘I knew that,’ or ‘darn I should have known that,’ or ‘I didn’t know that, but now I’m glad I do.’ That’s basically what we’re looking for.”<br><br>...<br><br>“In that category, the title is ‘let’s have a ball.’ The nice thing about having [a] category title that gives that much information is that then you can have shorter clues,” Wisse says. “If that category was just in a more random category, like ‘games’ or something like that, it would be tougher. But since you’re already telling them it’s a category about balls, you can have a short clue and the information needed is still going to be conveyed.” There’s a little more flexibility to be clever or coy.</blockquote>
