        <h3><a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2017/12/18/a-leadership-vacuum-the-last-jedi-and-mission-failure/">Angry Staff Officer - The Last Jedi and Mission Failure</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">Last week, we saw <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>. It's excellent and surprisingly layered; go see it. There are a bajillion articles about it, but one stood out as rather unique. It's a <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2017/12/18/a-leadership-vacuum-the-last-jedi-and-mission-failure/">military analysis of the command structure in both the First Order and Resistance in the film</a>, and the author raises some excllent points about how leaders need to act and communicate. A lot of it comes down to the way each group structures their decision-making:</p>
        <blockquote>There’s this concept in the U.S. military called “mission command.” It comes from the Prussian principle called “Auftragstaktik,” pioneered by Helmuth von Moltke in the late 19th century and it boils down to exercising disciplined initiative. That is, giving junior commanders the ability to seize opportunities as they arise without jeopardizing the entire force or operation. The German army used it to great effect in World War I where their units were able to be more flexible and fluid than those of their opponents. It is a concept that is markedly absent from the Star Wars franchise. The Empire and the First Order operate through the use of rigid command structures, with orders coming from the top down. If those orders are not executed to the letter, subordinate officers are in grave danger of being force-choked into submission. This breeds a command culture of absolute and total dedication to orders, which dooms them to fighting an unimaginative war. This is why Imperial and First Order fleets rarely display the levels of ingenuity in war that the Rebels and Resistance do.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">If you've seen the movie and want to think a bit about leadership and decision-making, <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2017/12/18/a-leadership-vacuum-the-last-jedi-and-mission-failure/">go read it</a>. (If you haven't, don't, because whoo boy spoilers. Go read <a href="https://angrystaffofficer.com/2017/07/10/warfighter-hoth/">his breakdown of the Hoth battle instead</a>.)</p>
