        <h3><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/magnus-carlsen-wins-the-2016-world-chess-championship/">Magnus Carlsen wins the World Chess Championship—in overtime</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">If you were following the site last week, you might've noticed that all our links had a "food" theme. This week, we get to catch up on things we saw last week, and the best place to start is the World Chess Championship.</p>
        <p class="comment">The end of it: <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/magnus-carlsen-wins-the-2016-world-chess-championship/">Magnus Carlsen retained the title</a> (on his 26th birthday, no less). But there was a lot more excitement because the Championship ended up tied at the end of the 12-game match, sending <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rooting-for-armageddon-at-the-world-chess-championship/">Carlsen and challenger Sergey Karjakin to the tiebreaker</a>. Although chess <a href="https://youtu.be/xFZp1EfggaE">is often REALLY boring to watch</a>, its tiebreaker is actually pretty creative:</p>
        <blockquote>First, a mini-match of four rapid games will be played. Each player gets 25 minutes for all of his moves, plus 10 bonus seconds after every move played.<br><br>
If the players remain tied after those four games,1 they’ll play a mini-match of two blitz games. Each player will get five minutes, plus three seconds after every move. They’ll keep playing those, if the two-game mini-matches are tied, for up to five total mini-matches (10 total blitz games).<br><br>
Finally, if none of that settles it, they’ll play one sudden-death game using a format known as Armageddon. White gets five minutes and black gets four minutes, but a drawn game counts as a win for black.</blockquote>
        <p class="comment">Anyone with half an ounce of humanity in their bodies was rooting for Armageddon because why not. Instead, Carlsen won it in the rapid match—but not without some difficulty. Game 2 was an incredibly fun, tense match, with Karjakin pulling out a draw despite being down in position, pieces, and time:</p>

        <p class="comment">I'm not a chess fan but I loved following Karjakin's Houdini-esque escape act in this game. He managed to keep enough of a perimeter long enough to find a way out of an impossible situation.</p> 
        <p class="comment">Yes, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/magnus-carlsen-wins-the-2016-world-chess-championship/">Carlsen flubbed a couple moves</a>. Yes, Karjakin lost the overall match. But this was an absolute stunner, a terrific defensive performance that capped a strong run. Losing to the wunderkind is no shame. And full marks to FIDE for enabling people to follow along with their live-update widget <em>and</em> be able to watch for $7. That's how to make people interested in your sport.</p>
