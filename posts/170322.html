        <p class="comment">A friend forwarded us <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents18931717/the-nba-secret-addiction">this feature by ESPN's Baxter Holmes</a>, and boy, is it terrific. This is perfect journalism: a clear hook, singing prose, tight editing, delectable illustrations...seriously, read this opening:</p>
        <blockquote>he legend has been passed down by NBA generations, chronicled like a Homeric odyssey. The tale they tell is of Kevin Garnett and the 2007-08 Celtics, and the seminal moment of a revolution. Bryan Doo, Celtics strength and conditioning coach, recalls it as if it were yesterday, how before a game in December of that season, an unnamed Celtic -- his identity lost to history, like the other horsemen on Paul Revere's midnight ride -- complained to Doo of incipient hunger pangs.<br><br>
        "Man, I could go for a PB&J," the player said.<br><br>
        And then Garnett, in an act with historical reverberations, uttered the now-fabled words: "Yeah, let's get on that."<br><br>
        Garnett had not, to that point, made the PB&J a part of his pregame routine. But on that night in Boston, as Doo recalls, Garnett partook, then played ... and played well. Afterward, from his perch as the Celtics' fiery leader, Garnett issued the following commandment: "We're going to need PB&J in here every game now."<br><br>
        And so a sandwich revolution was born.<br><br>
        At the time, Doo notes, the Celtics not only didn't provide lavish pregame spreads, they didn't offer much food at all. But he soon found himself slapping together 20 PB&J's about three hours before every tip-off, the finished products placed in bags and labeled with Sharpie in a secret code: "S" for strawberry, "G" for grape, "C" for crunchy. Of vital import: Garnett was an "S" man, and woe unto he who did not deliver him two S's before every game. "If Kevin didn't get his routine down, he'd be pissed," Doo says. "Even if he didn't eat them, he needed them to be there."</blockquote>
