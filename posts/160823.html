         <p class="def">To quibble over something, arguing pointlessly. Well, that might not be true. It's not really arguing. It's pointing out small but important details that are off. It doesn't have to be arguing with someone. It just has to be an unnecessary difference or distinction.</p>

        <h3><a href="http://www.arthouseamerica.com/blog/that-would-be-it-a-conversation-with-jan-peterson.html">Jan Petersen on hospitality</a></h3>
        <p class="comment">Jan Petersen is the wife of Eugene, the noted professor, pastor, translator, and introvert. We stumbled on <a href="http://www.arthouseamerica.com/blog/that-would-be-it-a-conversation-with-jan-peterson.html">a wonderful interview with her</a> recently that covered a lot of ground, especially relating to hospitality. Petersen left us thinking with this comment:</p>
        <blockquote>Phaedra Jean Taylor: What does hospitality mean to you? <br><br>Jan Petersen: Hospitality is serving people and helping people who are in our home. We listen. If they stay in our home, I fix meals and prepare a bed and so forth for them. I read something about—I think it is Benedict's Rule of Hospitality—that there's a difference between serving and being a servant. When I'm serving, I'm in charge. If I'm a servant, you're part of it. If you want to do something to help me, I'll let you do it because that's allowing you in. You're not being in charge. I'm not being in charge.<br><br>
I like that clarification. It was good for me. I think we treat people that way. I think we allow people to feel like they have a place in our home when they're here. They're not just being taken care of.<br><br>
PJT: I love that: inviting people in to be a part of it with you. It’s not just about you doing something that makes you feel good. It's about being with them as well. I love that distinction. <br><br>JP: It really was helpful. It kind of hit me right between the eyes too. I was guilty of serving but not being a servant. </blockquote>
	    <p class="comment"><a href="http://www.arthouseamerica.com/blog/that-would-be-it-a-conversation-with-jan-peterson.html">The whole interview is worth reading</a> and ruminating over.</p>
