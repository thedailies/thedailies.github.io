        <h3><a href="http://brightwalldarkroom.com/issue-44/2017/2/14/an-interview-with-guillermo-del-toro">An interview with Guillermo del Toro</a></h3>
		  <p class="comment">Is Guillermo del Toro a great interview subject because he's a great director or are the things that make him a great interview subject the same things that make him a great director? Either way, <a href="http://brightwalldarkroom.com/issue-44/2017/2/14/an-interview-with-guillermo-del-toro">this very long but fantastic interview over at Bright Wall, Dark Room</a> (which is an excellent site) covers a lot of ground, from filmmaking to politics to mortality. A glimpse:</p>
		  <blockquote>[Del Toro] You cannot choreograph a movie with more precision than that movie is choreographed. Every shot is a little masterclass about how to do internal montage, by which I mean the montage of the camera and actor’s ballet, you know? Most of the time you find discussions start and stop at content, at dramaturgy: what is it about, what the characters do, what does the story mean, politically and then, you know—<br><br>
		  [BW, DR] And if people talk about any craft aspect, they’ll talk about the actors.<br><br>
		  [Del Toro] They talk about the actors, or they talk about the cinematography, but the reality is, when you orchestrate a movie, you’re orchestrating everything—and only about a third of it is often discussed.<br><br>
		  [BW, DR] One thing that I’ve noticed is that when people talk about cinematography, they’ll say that something is ‘beautifully shot’. But a lot of what they’re perceiving as beautiful is actually design.<br><br>
		  [Del Toro] I watch movies perhaps in a different way, because I try to get absorbed the first time. I’m not analyzing it the first time. If I find myself analyzing the first time, it’s not a good movie.<br><br>
		  I carry my iPad and my computer. In them, I carry about 2,500 movies, which I often consult, like you would read a book. I often turn it on and just watch a passage. I watch it from a purely formal point of view, and I go: can I dissect it? Can I dissect what lens they’re using, can I dissect which one of the shots is the master and which ones are coverage? This is something I’ve been doing since I was a teenager, because some people are just masters at blocking a scene. John Schlesinger is just superb—he’s always doing these nifty little things with choreography. Polanski is masterful at a minimalism of extreme precision in choreographing. There are many, many people that I love to discuss in those terms because we are talking the film’s language.<br><br>
		  I think film, as a medium, sometimes succeeds below the radar of people’s perception. The four legs of a movie, visually, to me are: cinematography, set design, wardrobe design, and camera moves. They are all orchestrated, in the best circumstances, by the director. They need to be, basically, a single department. When you say, 'What a beautiful work of cinematography,' nine out of ten times, you’re praising the set design and wardrobe design. But you don’t consciously know it. For a movie to be beautiful, it needs to be sustained by those four legs. They can be in harmony or in contrast, but they need to be orchestrated.</blockquote>
